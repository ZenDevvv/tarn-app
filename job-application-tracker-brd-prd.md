# Tarn
## Business Requirements Document (BRD) + Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Draft / Development Reference  
**Product Type:** Personal Job Search Management Web Application  
**Primary User:** Job seeker / applicant  
**Last Updated:** September 30, 2026

---

# 1. Product Overview

## 1.1 Product Name

**Tarn**

> The product name is **Tarn**, decided on 2026-10-01. Earlier drafts referred to it as a working title ("Job Application Tracker"); that name is retired and must not be used for the product.

## 1.2 Product Summary

Tarn is a personal web application designed to help job seekers organize, monitor, and manage their entire job-search process from a single place.

The application centralizes job opportunities and applications collected from platforms such as LinkedIn, Indeed, JobStreet, OnlineJobsPH, company career websites, referrals, and other sources.

Instead of maintaining scattered spreadsheets, browser bookmarks, notes, emails, and calendars, users can manage applications, job descriptions, companies, recruiters, interviews, resumes, follow-ups, and offers through one system.

The product should evolve from a simple application tracker into a personal **Applicant Tracking System (ATS)** focused on the job seeker.

---

# 2. Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## 2.1 Business Problem

Job seekers commonly apply to multiple positions across different platforms. As the number of applications increases, it becomes difficult to remember:

- Which companies have been contacted
- Which position was applied for
- Where the application came from
- When the application was submitted
- What the current application status is
- When to follow up
- Which recruiter or hiring contact was involved
- Which resume or cover letter was submitted
- What the original job description contained
- When interviews are scheduled
- What preparation is required
- Which applications are still active
- Which applications resulted in interviews or offers

Existing solutions such as spreadsheets can track basic information but often require significant manual maintenance and do not provide a workflow optimized specifically for job seekers.

## 2.2 Business Opportunity

The application can provide a centralized system that turns a fragmented job-search process into a structured workflow:

**Discover → Save → Review → Apply → Follow Up → Interview → Offer → Outcome**

The application can also preserve job descriptions and application history, allowing users to review their job-search activity and identify patterns over time.

## 2.3 Product Goals

### Primary Goals

1. Centralize all job applications in one application.
2. Make it easy to add and update applications.
3. Provide a clear view of application status.
4. Prevent important follow-ups from being forgotten.
5. Track interviews and interview preparation.
6. Preserve job descriptions after applying.
7. Track companies, recruiters, contacts, resumes, and cover letters.
8. Provide useful job-search analytics.
9. Eventually reduce manual data entry through automation and AI.
10. Provide a scalable foundation for integrations such as email, calendar, and browser extensions.

### Secondary Goals

1. Help users understand their job-search funnel.
2. Help users prepare for interviews.
3. Help users compare job opportunities using factual information.
4. Maintain a searchable historical record of their job-search activity.
5. Demonstrate modern full-stack application capabilities as a portfolio project.

## 2.4 Non-Goals

The initial product will **not**:

- Automatically submit job applications without explicit user action.
- Automatically make employment decisions for the user.
- Guarantee job compatibility or hiring success.
- Automatically scrape platforms in ways that violate their terms of service.
- Replace official recruitment systems.
- Automatically communicate with recruiters without user approval.

AI-generated match information should be treated as assistance, not as an authoritative hiring or career decision.

---

# 3. Target User

## 3.1 Primary Persona — Active Job Seeker

A professional actively applying to multiple jobs through different platforms.

### Characteristics

- Applies to multiple positions per week.
- Uses LinkedIn, Indeed, JobStreet, OnlineJobsPH, company websites, referrals, etc.
- Has multiple versions of their resume.
- Needs to remember interview schedules.
- Communicates with recruiters.
- Wants to follow up professionally.
- Wants historical records of applications.
- May apply to different roles at the same company.

## 3.2 User Needs

The user needs to quickly answer:

- What jobs have I applied to?
- What is happening with each application?
- What should I do next?
- Which interviews are upcoming?
- Who contacted me?
- What resume did I submit?
- What did the original job posting say?
- What skills does this position require?
- How is my application pipeline progressing?

---

# 4. Product Principles

## 4.1 Simple First

Adding an application should require minimal effort.

## 4.2 Next Action Driven

Every active application should make it clear what the user's next action is.

## 4.3 Historical Context

Important changes should be preserved through an application timeline.

## 4.4 User Control

Automation and AI should assist the user rather than make irreversible decisions.

## 4.5 Searchable

All application information should be easy to find.

## 4.6 Scalable

The initial architecture should support future integrations and automation without requiring a complete rewrite.

---

# 5. Core Application Lifecycle

The primary application lifecycle is:

```text
SAVED
  ↓
APPLIED
  ↓
APPLICATION VIEWED
  ↓
RECRUITER CONTACTED
  ↓
HR INTERVIEW
  ↓
TECHNICAL INTERVIEW
  ↓
FINAL INTERVIEW
  ↓
OFFER
  ↓
ACCEPTED
```

Alternative outcomes:

```text
Any Active Stage
      ↓
   REJECTED

Any Active Stage
      ↓
  WITHDRAWN

APPLIED
   ↓
NO RESPONSE
```

The system should allow users to move applications between statuses without forcing a single rigid workflow.

# 31. Technical Architecture — High-Level

The technical implementation is intentionally flexible.

Recommended conceptual architecture:

```text
                    Web Client
                        │
                        ▼
                 Application API
                        │
          ┌─────────────┼─────────────┐
          ▼             ▼             ▼
      Database       File Storage   AI Service
          │
          ▼
     Application Data

Future Integrations
          │
    ┌─────┼─────┬─────────┐
    ▼     ▼     ▼         ▼
  Gmail Calendar Browser Notifications
```

The exact technologies can be selected during technical planning.

# 32. Security Architecture

The system should implement:

- Authentication
- Authorization
- Server-side ownership validation
- Input validation
- Secure file handling
- Rate limiting where appropriate
- Secure cookies/tokens
- CSRF protection where applicable
- API request validation
- Audit logging for sensitive account actions

Users must never be able to access another user's application data by manipulating IDs or API requests.

---

# 33. Data Ownership

Each user's:

- Applications
- Companies
- Contacts
- Interviews
- Files
- Notes
- Analytics
- Saved jobs

must be associated with the authenticated user.

All server-side queries must enforce ownership boundaries.

# 34. Product Risks

## Risk 1 — Too Much Manual Entry

### Mitigation

Prioritize quick-add workflows and eventually support JD extraction, email parsing, and browser extensions.

## Risk 2 — Feature Overload

### Mitigation

Keep MVP focused on:

```text
Applications
Status
Timeline
Follow-ups
Job Details
Dashboard
```

## Risk 3 — AI Accuracy

### Mitigation

AI-generated information must be editable and clearly presented as generated assistance.

## Risk 4 — Integration Reliability

### Mitigation

Treat integrations as optional modules rather than dependencies for the core product.

## Risk 5 — Job Platform Restrictions

### Mitigation

Do not build unauthorized scraping or automation as a core requirement. Prefer official APIs, user-triggered workflows, email parsing, or browser-extension functionality where permitted.

# 35. MVP Definition of Done

The product is ready for MVP release when:

1. A user can securely create and access an account.
2. A user can create, edit, and manage applications.
3. Applications can be moved through the application pipeline.
4. Each application has a complete detail view.
5. Job descriptions can be stored.
6. Companies can be associated with applications.
7. Application history is preserved in a timeline.
8. Follow-ups can be created and completed.
9. Dashboard metrics accurately reflect application data.
10. Applications can be searched and filtered.
11. The interface works on desktop and mobile.
12. Data is isolated between users.
13. Validation and error handling are implemented.
14. Core workflows do not depend on AI or third-party integrations.

---

# 36. Future Product Vision

The long-term vision is to make Tarn a personal **Job Search Operating System**.

The user's workflow should eventually look like:

```text
                FIND JOB
                   │
                   ▼
               SAVE JOB
                   │
                   ▼
             ANALYZE JOB
                   │
          ┌────────┴────────┐
          ▼                 ▼
       MATCHING          PREPARE
          │                 │
          └────────┬────────┘
                   ▼
                 APPLY
                   │
                   ▼
               FOLLOW UP
                   │
                   ▼
               INTERVIEW
                   │
                   ▼
             PREPARE / TRACK
                   │
                   ▼
                 OFFER
                   │
                   ▼
                OUTCOME
                   │
                   ▼
              ANALYTICS
```

The system should remain centered around one principle:

> **Help the job seeker know what applications they have, what is happening with them, and what they need to do next.**

# 38. Document Status

**Current Status:** Product requirements baseline established. Amended 2026-10-01 by owner decisions (see Decision Log below).

This document should be treated as the initial product source of truth. Technical implementation decisions, database schema details, API contracts, UI component specifications, and deployment architecture should be documented separately during development.

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Effect on this document |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-01 | Product name is **Tarn** | §1.1. "Job Application Tracker" retired as a product name. |
| 2026-10-01 | **Authentication is in scope for MVP** | Confirms §7.1 and §35 item 1. An earlier proposal to ship MVP without auth was rejected; the ownership boundary in §33 and PRD §35 item 12 stand. |
| 2026-10-01 | **SavedJob, Skill, and Offer are in MVP scope** | §6 Phase 1, §37 matrix. Promoted from Phase 2. |
| 2026-10-01 | **Notification deferred to Phase 2** | §6 Phase 2, §37 matrix. No notification table, channel, or UI in MVP. |
| 2026-10-01 | **pnpm confirmed** as package manager | Recorded in `job-application-tracker-project-architecture.md` §5. |
| 2026-10-01 | Design tokens move to `apps/web/src/index.css` at scaffold time | Recorded in `DESIGN.md` §1. Not yet executed; the token file is currently at repository root. |

Notes on the Skill scope split: the **Skill** entity ships in MVP so skills can be captured and stored against jobs. AI-driven skill **extraction** and **matching** remain Phase 3 (§8.2).

**Next recommended artifacts:**

1. Technical Requirements Document (TRD)
2. Database / ERD specification
3. API specification
4. UI/UX screen specification
5. MVP development task breakdown
6. AI feature specification
7. Testing strategy
8. Deployment architecture
